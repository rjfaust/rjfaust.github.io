          <p>This survey evaluates Anteater: a system for tracing programs and creating interactive visualizations of program execution values in context.</p>
        </div>


          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of Anteater,
            a visual debugging tool.  Anteater was designed to aid everyday programmers in understanding
            and debugging their programs through the use of interactive visualizations.  To evaluate
            Anteater, we are having participants with programming experience complete debugging tasks
            using Anteater and a standard debugging tool to gather their feedback on their experiences
            with the two tools. Note, this survey must be completed on the Google Chrome browser.</p>


            <h3>Length & Compensation</h3>
            <p>This study will take 30-60 minutes. You will be asked to debug two programs,
              one with Anteater and one with a more traditional debugging technique.  As
              compensation, you will be entered into a drawing for a $100 Amazon giftcard.
              </p>
                <br/>
              <p>
                The survey will be hosted through google forms.  If you would like to participate,
                and meet the qualifications of being 18 years or older, having some programming
                experience and being able to complete the survey on Google Chrome, 
                please click on "Begin Survey" below.

I am an Assistant Professor at [Tulane University](https://sse.tulane.edu/cs). I completed my PhD from the University of Arizona in 2021, working with Dr. Carlos Scheidegger. After completing my PhD, I was a postdoc and [CI Fellow](https://cifellows2021.org) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/) working with [Dr. Chris North](https://people.cs.vt.edu/north/) from January 2022 - December 2023.
My research interests lie at the intersection of data science/analysis and visualization. Specifically, I am interested in
creating visualization methods and systems to increase understandability of analysis programs and workflows, as well as faciliate human interaction with analysis methods to faciliate human-ai interaction.


My current work focuses on using program transformations to extract information from programs as they
execute and visualizing the extracted information to faciliate explainability. Initially, I focused on extracting
information specifically from dimensionality reduction methods to help explain the resulting projections
(see [DimReader](/publication/2018-DimReader)). After completing that project, I shifted to
extracting and visualizing execution information and values from python programs through
program traces for the purpose of debugging and understanding these programs (see
[Anteater](/portfolio/Anteater/)).

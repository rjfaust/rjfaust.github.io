I am an Assistant Professor at [Tulane University](https://sse.tulane.edu/cs). I completed my PhD from the University of Arizona in 2021, working with Dr. Carlos Scheidegger. After completing my PhD, I was a postdoc and [CI Fellow](https://cifellows2021.org) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/) working with [Dr. Chris North](https://people.cs.vt.edu/north/) from January 2022 - December 2023.
My research interests lie at the intersection of data science/analysis, visualization, and human-ai interaction. Sepcifically, I am interested in designing and studying interactive visualization methods to support humans in data analytics such as in understanding analysis results, providing feedback into analytics methods, and reducing manual burdens of the analysis process.

My current work focuses on using program transformations to extract information from programs as they
execute and visualizing the extracted information to facilitate explainability. Initially, I focused on extracting
information specifically from dimensionality reduction methods to help explain the resulting projections
(see [DimReader](/publication/2018-DimReader)). After completing that project, I shifted to
extracting and visualizing execution information and values from python programs through
program traces for the purpose of debugging and understanding these programs (see
[Anteater](/portfolio/Anteater/)).

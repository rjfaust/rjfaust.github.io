I am a fifth year PhD candidate in the [HDC lab](http://hdc.cs.arizona.edu) at the University of Arizona, expecting to graduate in Fall 2021.
My research interests lie at the intersection of data science/analysis and visualization, specifically
creating visualization methods and systems to increase understandability of analysis programs and workflows.

My advisor is [Dr. Carlos Scheidegger](https://cscheid.net).  I am currently a
[NIST GMSE Fellow](https://www.nist.gov/iaao/academic-affairs-office/nist-graduate-student-measurement-science-and-engineering-gmse)
 working with [Dr. William Bernstein](https://www.nist.gov/people/william-z-bernstein) on
 research to help analysts better understand and debug their analysis programs using visualization.

My current work focuses on using program transformations to extract information from programs as they
execute and visualizing the extracted information. Initially, I focused on extracting
information specifically from dimensionality reduction methods to help explain the resulting projections
(see [DimReader](/publication/2018-DimReader)). After completing that project, I shifted to
extracting and visualizing execution information and values from python programs through
program traces for the purpose of debugging and understanding these programs (see
[Anteater](/portfolio/Anteater/)).

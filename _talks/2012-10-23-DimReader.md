In this talk, I present DimReader: Axis Lines that Explain Non-Linear Projections. DimReader is a technique that recovers readable axes from dimensionality reduction techniques by analyzing inÔ¨Ånitesimal perturbations of the dataset with respect to variables of interest. This talk was presented at IEEE VIS 2018.

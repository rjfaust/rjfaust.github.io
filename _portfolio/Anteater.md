title: "Anteater: Interactive Visualization of Program Execution Values in Context"
excerpt: "Anteater is an interactive visualization system for tracing and exploring the execution of a program. It alleviates the burden of manual instrumentation by automatically instrumenting source code to track the values that the user desires to inspect, along with the execution trace. Anteater presents the trace to users through various visualizations. <br/><img src='/files/images/AnteaterTeaser.jpg' style='width:500px'>"

Debugging is famously one the hardest parts in programming. This project aims to alleviate some of the debugging burden by creating a debugging environment that incorporates interactive visualization into the debugging process. Our debugging tool, Anteater, alleviates the burden of manual instrumentation by automatically instrumenting source code to track the values that the user desires to inspect, along with the execution trace. It then presents this information to the user through various interactive visualizations. These interactive visualizations help with tasks such as discovering important structures in the execution and understanding and debugging unexpected behaviors and values.

A demo version of Anteater can be found [here](/files/Anteater/index.html).
